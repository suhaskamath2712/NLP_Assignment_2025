# Assignment 2: Language Modelling (TA: Navreet Kaur)

The goal of this assignment is to model Indian first names using character-level language models.

You'll have to add your code wherever you see the comment `# ADD YOUR CODE HERE`. Please make a copy of this assignment, and you can use Google Colab notebooks to work on this. Later, you can download this notebook as a python file and submit it as per the following instructions.

**Important Note**: Whenever you add your code, please enclose your code block within two comments `# BEGIN CODE` and `# END CODE` to indicate the start and end of your code.
Example:

```
def model():

    data = get_dataloader() # this is defined by us

    # ADD YOUR CODE HERE

    # BEGIN CODE

    run_training() # this is written by you

    generate_names() # this is written by you

    # END CODE

```

## Submission Instructions

Note that your assignment will be based on the results obtained by functions implemented by you. Do not change the print statements having `EVALUATION` as they are used for auto-evaluation.

You'd need to submit the following files:

  * Save this `.ipynb` to your drive, complete the required code blocks and run the notebook.

  * After completing this assignment, download the notebook as`.py`. Name it as `SAPname_SRno_assignment2.py`, where `SAPname` refers to your name as per SAP record, and `SRno` refers to the last 5 digits of your IISc SR number. For example, IISc student with SAP name Twyla Linda (SR no - 04-03-00-10-22-20-1-15329) would name it as `Twyla_Linda_15329_assignment2.py`.

  *   The files associated with FNN and RNN models i.e. `model.pt`, `vocab.pt` and `loss.json` will be downloaded and saved in folders with names `fnn` and `rnn` respectively, and these will be contained within folder `SAPname_SRno`. Zip this folder along with the `.py` file, save it as `SAPname_SRno_assigment2` and upload on MS Teams. The directory can be summarised as follows:

```
SAPname_SRno_assigment2
│   SAPname_SRno_assignment2.py  
│
└───SAPname_SRno
│   │
│   └───fnn
│   │   │   model.pt
│   │   │   vocab.pt
│   │   │   loss.json
│   │
│   └───rnn
│       │   model.pt
│       │   vocab.pt
│       │   loss.json

```

Because submissions are auto-graded, please ensure that the naming of the files is consistent with the instructions.

## Broad Outline

In this assignment, we will implement different types of language models for modeling Indian names. There are clealry patterns in Indian names that models could learn, and we start modeling those using n-gram models, then move to neural n-gram and RNN models.

"""
Now it's time to implement an [n-gram language model](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).

One edge case you will need to handle is that you don't have $n-1$ prior characters at the beginning of the text.  One way to do this is by appending the `START` token $n-1$ times at the start of the name, when implementing an $n$-gram model. You may choose whichever method you like to handle this case as long as you produce a valid probability distribution (one that sums to one).

**Generating names**

To generate from a language model, we can sample one char at a time conditioning on the chars we have generated so far.

In fact there are many strategies to get better-sounding samples, such as only sampling from the top-k chars or sharpening the distribution with a temperature.  You can read more about sampling from a language model in [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09751.pdf) paper.


We will now implement N-gram models with $N=1$ (unigram), $N=2$ (bigram), and $N=3$ (trigram).

**Utility Functions**

Implement the utility functions `get_unigram_counts`, `get_bigram_counts` and `get_trigram_counts`. You can use these functions while implementing n-gram models."""

"""#### FNN Implementation

**Feed-forward Neural Language Modelling**

Like the n-gram LM, the feedforward neural LM approximates the probability of a char given the entire prior context $P(w_t|w_{1:t−1})$ by approximating based on the $N-1$ previous chars:
$$P(w_t|w_1,...,w_{t−1}) ≈ P(w_t|w_{t−N+1},...,w_{t−1})$$


Implement the FNN LM given in this paper: [Neural Probabilistic Language Model](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)

The architecture of the FNN can be described by the equation and figure:

$$y = b + W x + U \text t \text a \text n \text h (d + H x)$$

- $x$ is of size $(ngram-1)*m$ where $m$ is the size embedding dimensions
- $y$ is of size $V*1$ where $V$ is the vocabulary size

![FNN_LM](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aQhkXjWelHfiBfmBQV3z5TjHFNMtqtzT)


**Some tips**:
- embed the chars with dimension $m$ (example, $60$), then flatten into a single embedding for  $n-1$  chars (with size  $(n-1)*m$ )
- you can use Adam or Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimising the cross entropy loss
- If you are using SGD, you may want to use momentum, and a learning rate scheduler
- do early stopping based on validation set loss or perplexity

**Important**: Fix seed as 42 whenever performing any randomized operations, e.g., initializing ML models.
